            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <h5>02 May 2019</h5>
            
            <p>After doing some self-evaluation, I realized that despite putting in loads of effort, it can be hard for me to describe my skills and achievements.
              I haven't done the best job recording my progress, and I don't have a whole lot of experience to reference. In my current job, I spend much of my time
              developing a web application, so I decided to start a personal project where I can highlight the skills that I have learned on the job while chronicling
              my ongoing learning experiences. The first project I work on will be fleshing out this web application, turning it from the basic shell that it is now
              into a usable blogging site. Throughout that time, I will be developing other skills on my own, and for my classes at Syracuse. I hope to paint a good
              picture of my professional development, and maybe even help some others learn along the way.
