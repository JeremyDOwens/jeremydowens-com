The aim of this project is to build a personal portfolio and professional blogging website using the Play!
Framework.

This is for my own personal website, but I am striving to ensure that the code is easily adapted for use
by anyone who would like to operate a similar site. There are some items that are static and built into the twirl
templates. Over time, I plan to factor that out into configuration and database references. As that happens, the SETUP
section will be updated.

If you would like to contribute, contact jeremy@jeremydowens.com

SETUP:

1. Declare the following environment variables

APPLICATION_SECRET - this is required for the Play Framework
DATABASE_URL - this is automatically generated on Heroku, but on other platforms may need to be explicitly declared
DNR_EMAIL - email address for automated emails
DNR_MAIL_PORT
DNR_MAIL_SERVER
DNR_PASSWORD

2. Change the following fields in application.conf to match your own site

sitevars {
  siteAddress="www.jeremydowens.com"
}

play.filters.hosts {
  # Allow requests to example.com, its subdomains, and localhost:9000.
  allowed = [".jeremydowens.com", "jeremy-d-owens.herokuapp.com"]
}
